# Settings Overview

Open **Settings, Note Narrator**. A tab bar at the top switches between six sections, each with its own page here.

![[settings-tab-overview.png]]

| Tab | Page | About |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **General** | [[General Settings]] | Default reading settings and default playback speed |
| **Providers** | [[Providers Settings]] | Connections to TTS services: API keys and parallel generation |
| **Profiles** | [[Profiles Settings]] | Narrator profiles: provider, voice settings, dropdown toggle, reading overrides |
| **Appearance** | [[Appearance Settings]] | Panel display, rewind and skip, and highlighting |
| **Performance** | [[Performance Settings]] | How playback starts |
| **Files** | [[Files Settings]] | Saving audio, linking it in notes, and cleanup |

> [!info] Greyed out, not hidden
> A setting that does not apply right now, because another setting is off, is **greyed out** instead of disappearing. Turn the setting it depends on back on and it becomes usable again.

> [!tip] Upgrading from an older version
> Your old voice, model, API key and parallel-generation settings are migrated automatically into one provider and one narrator profile named **Default**. See [[Providers Settings]] and [[Profiles Settings]].
