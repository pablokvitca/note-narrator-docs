# Long Notes and Chunking

ElevenLabs limits how much text one request can hold, so Note Narrator splits a note into **chunks**, generates them, and plays them in order.

## Text chunker

| Style | How it splits |
| --- | --- |
| **Markdown-aware** (default) | By heading section first (up to the max heading depth), then by sentence inside each section |
| **Sentence-only** | Ignores headings and packs sentences up to the character limit |

**Max heading depth** (default 2, and overridable per narrator profile) decides which headings start a new section: 1 is `#`, 2 is `##` and shallower, up to 6. Deeper headings stay inside their section.

> [!example] Skipping a section
> With the Markdown-aware chunker, add `Changelog` to **Skip sections by heading** and any section whose heading matches is never read, so its parts also disappear from the generation bar.

## Start playing sooner

- **Start playback immediately** (on): play as soon as the first chunk is ready instead of waiting for the whole note.
- **Quick start** (on): make that first chunk deliberately short (including the title and properties preamble) so audio starts faster. Size it in **Words** (default 150) or **Characters** (default 750).

> [!tip] Long notes
> Quick start matters most on long notes. The first sentence or two are generated alone, and everything else generates while you listen.

## Parallel generation

- **Generate chunks in parallel** (on): more than one chunk at a time. **Max parallel chunk generation** sets the window (default 2, recommended 2 to 5). Both are set **per provider**, because rate limits belong to the account. See [[Providers Settings]].
- More parallelism finishes long notes sooner, but makes more simultaneous requests and hits rate limits sooner.

> [!warning] Rate limits
> On an HTTP 429 from ElevenLabs, requests retry with exponential backoff (up to 8 retries, with the wait capped at 30 seconds) and generation falls back to one chunk at a time for the **rest of that read**. Each new read starts again at your configured parallelism.

## Saved audio and chunks

Saved audio remembers its own chunk boundaries so Previous/Next part and highlighting keep working during Play saved. If chunk-affecting settings changed since generation, the file plays as one non-navigable piece until you regenerate. See [[Saving Audio]] and [[Known Limitations]].
